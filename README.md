# JavaDesignPatterns

## Singleton Pattern
>This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

## Factory Design Pattern
>In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

## Adaptor Pattern
>Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
